## Getting Started

**This is how you set up your project locally.**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Code editor.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

- OPTIONAL: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed.

### Setup

- The first step you need, is download or clone the repo to your local machine.

### Install

- To install the dependecies, just run `npm install` or `yarn build` (if you got yarn) on your console/terminal.

### Usage

#### To open the project in your local machine, there is a few ways you can do that, but you will need a server to run the project.

- If you are using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), you can use the [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension on the `index.html` in the `build` folder by clicking with the right button of the mouse and selecting `Open with Live Server`.

- If you are not using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), you can run `npm run server` on your console/terminal. It'll give you an url that you can access through your browser and play game.

#

- If you want to make modifications on the project you will also need to open another window of the console/terminal and run `npm run build`(one time) and `npm run watch`(if you want to modify multiple things and just reload the browser to see them).

### Run tests

#### Unfortunately, it wasn't possible to write tests for this project. All functionalities use Phaser directly and it's not possible to change that.

### Deployment

The deploy of this project was made in [Netfily](https://www.netlify.com), but you can use any website that you want.
